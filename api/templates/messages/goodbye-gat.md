2. Are you done? Just give this message a :checkered_flag:

We'll be sending you a survey (also linked to from the last item in the program).  We need your feedback! Was this week useful to you? Say thank you by filling it out. :pray: :wave:

Instructors might be around, but, less so than before. Feel free to keep using Slack, but you can also ask any training quesions in the [Admins Gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/admins).
